# GSoC 2025 – Add Embedding Support to LLMClient

This repository documents my work as a Google Summer of Code 2025 contributor with the **Scala Center**, focused on the project:

> **“Add Embedding Support to LLMClient”**

The goal of this project is to integrate semantic embedding support into the [`llm4s`](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s) framework to enable advanced use cases like semantic search, contextual reasoning, and enhanced LLM input processing.
